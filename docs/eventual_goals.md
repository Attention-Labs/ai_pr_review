# WHAT DO WE WANT ? 

we want to analyze sets of changes to the codebase

to look for
- related things that will break
- possible bugs (important!)
- things we specify ourselves in natural language (this is for later, but things like "make sure docs arent out of date", or "follow this pattern when interacting with the database" etc)
- if we're not using libraries correctly (out of scope for now)

- some of this should be handled by linters and other "outside loop" things.
